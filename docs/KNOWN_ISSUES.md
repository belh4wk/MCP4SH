# Known issues – v0.4.0-preview1

* Tuning is optimised for a specific 4-transducer rig
  (2x TT25 pucks, 2x BST-1). Other hardware may require substantial
  gain adjustments.
* Some games expose noisy, delayed, or incomplete telemetry; in
  those cases certain MCP4SH effects (especially slip / ABS / scrub)
  may feel weaker or more binary than intended.
* Auto-calibration is not yet implemented; all tuning is manual.
* Plugin internals and exposed settings may change before any
  non-preview or commercial release.
* The Gearbox - Grinds effect is still a work-in-progress; use with caution.
  Effect might be jarring/misbehave.
